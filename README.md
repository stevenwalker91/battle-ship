A basic Battleship game as part of the [Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship). The main focus of this project was an opportunity to use Test Driven Development with Jest in a real project.

## Check the tests running:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stevenwalker91/battle-ship.git
